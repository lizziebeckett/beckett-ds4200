            The post-pandemic recovery period saw high inflation, labor market imbalances, and surprising labor market resiliency (Gelain & Lopez, 2024). Despite the unique recovery routes different industries took after the pandemic, the majority of labor market reporting focused on the mass layoffs taking place in technology-related sectors, consistent with the “herd” behavior of news media reflected earlier during the pandemic itself (Lu, Businger, Dollfus, et al. 2023). This gap between labor market reporting and actual labor market behavior, as well as the increase in the volume of labor market reporting, is likely to have had a negative impact on perceived job security and market confidence for labor market participants (Garz, 2012). The impact of consumer sentiment on macroeconomic behavior is widely recognized, while this effect has been little discussed on a labor market scale.
            <br></br>
            My paper will explore how the sentiments reflected in labor market reporting compare to actual labor market behavior, and how this relationship in turn influences market behavior in preceding quarters. By analyzing how language sentiments in news reporting differed from actual labor market health, how this difference impacted consumer sentiments, and, finally, how consumer sentiments influenced labor market activity, the causal effect of labor market reporting quality can be determined. If low-quality (i.e. inaccurate) reporting leads to worse labor market outcomes, better standards may need to be enforced for mainstream economic reporting.
